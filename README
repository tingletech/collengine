Collengine is designed to be a simple tool to describe collections
of items for digitization projects.

Models
======

User
----
Default django user auth

Collections
-----------
Minimal colleciton level record at the intellectual level of an EAD finding aid.
(right now very skeletal; but will be based on DC)
(could allow attached PDFs)

Institutions
------------
Institution contributing content to the project
use ARK to link to record in voro dashboard records?
or copy voro institution model into this app?

Items
-----
Based on Dublin Core; "inherits" data from Collection and Institution records.
(could allow attached files)
(could allow descriptions to be HTML)
(could allow attached metadata files)
(eventual export to METS)
